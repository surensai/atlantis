   <!--<p class="p-font">Square Panda Inc. (SP) complies with COPPA (http://www.coppa.org), the Children's Online Privacy
    Protection Act.</p>

  <p class="p-font">SP collects information from the parent about their child, in order that we can personalize the
    child's experience,
    enhance and personalize the child's educational curriculum and keep the parent informed of their child's progress.
    We also may contact the parent to let them know of new software releases or updates, or
    news about SP.</p>

  <p class="p-font">Because SP products are educationally focused and targeted at the youngest children, the SP products
    are designed
    with the child's privacy in mind.</p>

  <p class="p-font">SP collects NO Personal Information (PI) directly from the child. We only collect the minimum amount
    of information
    from the child's game play to allow us to track the child's progress across multiple games and provide feedback
    to the parent via our parent portal. This information is collected passively during game play and only consists
    of encrypted device and player identifiers.</p>

  <p class="p-font">SP collects NON PI educational information fron the child's activities playing with our games and
    play set.
    This information is used to track the child's educational progress and present this progress to the parent.
    This data MAY be anonymized and aggregated to improve SP products, validate our curriculum approach, and
    contribute to educational research.
  </p>

  <p class="p-font">Parents have the right to view the PI data collected for their child and to opt out of the
    collection and
    usage of any PI data of their child.</p>
